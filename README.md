*A voice-enabled, multi-agent AI system that listens to you, understands your career goals, and autonomously hunts for job opportunities — like having J.A.R.V.I.S. as your personal career advisor.*

## 🎯 What is HUNTERS?

**HUNTERS** is an advanced multi-agentic AI career operating system — not a chatbot, not a wrapper, but a fully autonomous pipeline of specialized AI agents that **hunt jobs for you**.

You don't scroll job boards. You don't write cover letters. You don't track applications in spreadsheets. You just **talk**.

Think of it as **J.A.R.V.I.S. meets an entire recruitment agency**, except it works 24/7, never forgets your preferences, and actually submits applications on your behalf.

**The Vision:**
> *"Hunter, find AI Engineering internships in Bangalore, rank them against my profile, draft cover letters for the top 3, and apply to all of them."*

Hunter will listen, understand your intent, delegate tasks across a network of specialized AI agents — Scout, Resume Analyzer, Match, Apply, Outreach, Tracker — orchestrate their work through LangGraph, use MCP tools to interact with real-world systems (browsers, file systems, Notion, Gmail), generate evidence reports, ask for your approval on critical actions, and speak the results back to you. **End-to-end. Fully automated.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- A microphone
- A [HuggingFace API Key](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) with access to Meta Llama 3.1

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wade-wilson-00/HUNTERS---Multi-agentic-AI-Job-application-system.git
cd HUNTERS---Multi-agentic-AI-Job-application-system

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up your environment variables
# Create a .env file with:
HUGGING_FACE_API=your_huggingface_api_key_here
```

### Run Hunter

```bash
python app.py --mode voice  # or just python app.py and choose from menu
```

The app supports two modes:
- **Voice Mode**: Speak naturally. Hunter uses Silero VAD to know when you've stopped speaking and replies automatically.
- **Text Mode**: Use standard keyboard input if you prefer not to talk, while still getting voice responses.
